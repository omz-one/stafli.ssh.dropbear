# Docker General Purpose System Distro
General-purpose system distro builds based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), and developed as scripts for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 1.6.x or higher due to the [version 2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#versioning) format of the docker-compose.yml files.

The docker-compose.yml are separated by distribution and require .env files to function properly.  
A rudimentary script [docker-compose-helper.sh](../../tree/master/docker-compose-helper.sh) is provided to help with loading these.

Scripts are also provided to help test and deploy the installation procedures in non-Docker environments.

The images are automatically built at a [repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/solict/general-purpose-system-distro) in the Docker Hub registry.

## Distributions
The profiles use the official images as a starting point:
- __Debian__, from the [official repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)
  - [Debian 8 (jessie)](../../tree/master/debian8)
  - [Debian 7 (wheezy)](../../tree/master/debian7)
- __CentOS__, from the [official repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/)
  - [CentOS 7 (centos7)](../../tree/master/centos7)
  - [CentOS 6 (centos6)](../../tree/master/centos6)

## Profiles
These are the profiles described by the dockerfiles:
- Minimal, built with common software
- Standard, built on Minimal profile and included daemon packages
- Devel, built on Standard profile and additional development packages

## Images
These are the [resulting images](https://hub.docker.com/r/solict/general-purpose-system-distro/tags/) upon building:
- Minimal profile:
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian8_minimal
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian7_minimal
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:centos7_minimal
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:centos6_minimal
- Standard profile:
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian8_standard
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian7_standard
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:centos7_standard
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:centos6_standard
- Devel profile:
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian8_devel
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian7_devel
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:centos7_devel
  - solict/general-purpose-system-distro:centos6_devel

## Containers
These containers are generated upon issuing a create:
- Minimal profile:
  - debian8_minimal_xxx
  - debian7_minimal_xxx
  - centos7_minimal_xxx
  - centos6_minimal_xxx
- Standard profile:
  - debian8_standard_xxx
  - debian7_standard_xxx
  - centos7_standard_xxx
  - centos6_standard_xxx
- Devel profile:
  - debian8_devel_xxx
  - debian7_devel_xxx
  - centos7_devel_xxx
  - centos6_devel_xxx

## Usage

### From Docker Hub repository (basics)

Note: this method will not allow you to use the docker-compose files nor the script.

1. To pull the images, try typing:  
`docker pull <image_url>`
2. You can start a new container interactively by typing:  
`docker run -ti <image_url> /bin/bash`

Where <image_url> is the full image url (lookup the image list above).

Examples:
```
docker pull solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian7_minimal
docker run -ti solict/general-purpose-system-distro:debian7_minimal /bin/bash
```

### From GitHub repository (advanced)

1. Download the repository [zip file](https://github.com/solict/docker-general-purpose-system-distro/archive/master.zip) and unpack it or clone the repository using:  
`git clone https://github.com/solict/docker-general-purpose-system-distro.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory with a terminal and type:  
`docker-compose-helper --project=<distro> <operation>`

Where <distro> is the distribution/directory and <operation> is the desired docker-compose operation.

Examples:
```
./docker-compose-helper.sh --project=debian7 build
./docker-compose-helper.sh --project=debian7 create
./docker-compose-helper.sh --project=debian7 start
./docker-compose-helper.sh --project=debian7 stop
./docker-compose-helper.sh --project=debian7 rm
```
